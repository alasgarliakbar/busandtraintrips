Okay, I have the results. But before I share the R results for exp 31, let's do the same process for exp 32. I'll give results for both in the end. Instructions for experiment 32: "Instructions â€“ Experiment 32 As before, each bidder knows her own value, but does not know the value of the other bidders. The only difference between this experiment and the experiment before is the bidding process. After every bidder received her value, the bidding process starts. Simultaneously and only once, all bidders are asked to submit their bid for the certificate. The auction winner is the bidder who submitted the highest bid (with random selection in case of a tie). However, the price the winner has to pay for the certificate will be equal to the second highest bid of all four bids, i.e. the highest bid among the three bids which did not win. Thus, the payoff of the auction winner from this experiment will be her value for the certificate minus the price she paid (which is equal to the second highest bid submitted in the auction). The other bidders will have a payoff of zero. Any questions?" Variable description in "data_experiment32.xlsx": same as before, only that "The data is sorted by cohort, group, bidder_id" and questions: "Analyze Experiment 32: 2nd price sealed bid auction a) Derive the equilibrium bidding strategy of a bidder with a value of V. What changes ifyou raise/lower your bid? Should you submit a bid equal to your value? Why, or whynot? Does your strategy depend on the strategies and values of other players?b) If all bidders bid this way, who will be the auction winner? Which price will she pay?c) Analyze the data set of the experiment. How do participants bid?"
